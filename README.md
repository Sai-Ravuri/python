**list in python:**
                In one list we can insert strings and numbers with cogitations
   syntax: <list_name> = ['a','b','c']
   example: name = ['s','w','e','e','t','y',4].

    **Mutations** once verify

    **Methods in lists:**

        Append: <list>.append(<element>)
                Append adds new element at the end of the existent list_variable
        Value in list:
                       <value> in <list>
                       ex: p=[0,1,2]
                           print 3 in p
                       o/p: False (bcz 3 is not there in list p)
                       ex: p=[0,1,2]
                           print 2 in p
                       o/p: True (bcz 2 is presented in list p)
         Pop: <list>.pop()
                    Mutates the list by removing and returning its last element
                    ex: if a=[1,2,3]
                            b=a
                            then a refer to 1,2,3 and b also refer to 1,2,3,
                            now x= a.pop() then result will be last element od a i.e, 3 same time it change b elemts also that is call mutation
